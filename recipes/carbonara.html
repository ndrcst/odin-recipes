        <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
        <ul>            
            <li>4 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>½ pound sliced pancetta, chopped</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>½ cup pine nuts, toasted</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>¾ cup chopped Italian flat leaf parsley</li>
            <li>½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>                       
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps: </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together the eggs, cream, and 1 cup of Parmesan cheese in a bowl. Blend thoroughly, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the pasta, and cook until al dente, 
                or for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain pasta, then return it to the pot (off of the heat), and cover to keep warm.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat the olive oil over medium heat in a large skillet; add the onion and cook until transparent,
                 about 8 minutes. Remove onion from the skillet; place in a bowl, and cover to keep warm.
            </li>
            <li>Using the same skillet, cook the pancetta over medium heat until browned, tossing with nutmeg. Drain on paper towels.</li>
            <li>Combine the pasta, onion, pancetta, pine nuts, salt, and pepper in the same large skillet over low heat. 
                Slowly stir in the egg-cream mixture, tossing gently so the eggs don't scramble. Cook until just heated through. 
                Remove from heat and toss with parsley and remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately.
            </li>
        </ol>
